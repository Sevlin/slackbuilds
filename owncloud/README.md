**ownCloud** gives you universal access to your files through a web interface or WebDAV. It also provides a platform to easily view & sync your contacts, calendars and bookmarks across all your devices and enables basic editing right on the web. Installation has minimal server requirements, doesnâ€™t need special permissions and is quick. ownCloud is extendable via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins.  

By default, there is only a sample config file included with the package. 

You can override **DOCROOT**, **PHPUSER**, **PHPGROUP** and **CRONUSER** at build time.
They default to **DOCROOT=/var/www/**, **PHPUSER=root**, **PHPGROUP=apache**, **CRONUSER=apache**.
