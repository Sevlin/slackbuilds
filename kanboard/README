MantisBT is an open source issue tracker that provides a delicate balance 
between simplicity and power.

By default, there is only a sample config file included with the package.
You can either copy that file and edit it according to your taste or you
can do a graphical setup.  Both processes are detailed in the docs.

You can override DOCROOT, PHPUSER, and PHPGROUP at build time.
They default to DOCROOT=/var/www, PHPUSER=root, PHPGROUP=apache.
